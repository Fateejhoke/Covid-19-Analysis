# Covid-19-Analysis
# INTRODUCTION
The highly contagious respiratory disease COVID-19, also referred to as Coronavirus Disease 2019, was caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The outbreak of COVID-19 was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and quickly spread to become a global health crisis. Mild to severe symptoms might range from diarrhea and congestion to fever, coughing, shortness of breath, exhaustion, loss of taste or smell, muscle aches and some people don't show symptoms. The virus primarily spreads through respiratory droplets from an infected person when they cough, sneeze, or breathe. Additionally, It can also spread by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching the face. This pandemic had a great impact on global economies, daily life, education and public health. To stop the spread of the virus, governments and health organizations around the world have put in place a number of strategies, including mass testing, contact tracking, social isolation, mask requirements, vaccine campaigns and travel bans.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
This analysis aims to comprehend the effects of the COVID-19 spread and the reactions of nations around the world to the virus in order to continuously develop solutions to the situation.

# DATA SOURCE
This dataset was web scraped from the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Centre for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University. It usually gets updated every 24 hours from the official source. The data contains daily time series summary tables, including confirmed deaths and recoveries. Here is the raw file to access:

# DATA TRANSFORMATION
The dataset consists of three spreadsheets, namely, confirmed cases, death cases, and recovered cases. Using Microsoft Excel’s power query editor, I examined the dataset for the correct data types, removed empty columns, and ensured effective data quality. The three tables were merged into a single table named consolidated data. The year, month, and day columns were created from the data using appropriate functions for each, respectively. Finally, the cleaned data was loaded, and an analysis was generated for visualization.

# FINDINGS
•	The United States has the largest COVID-19 infection prevalence, with over 53 billion confirmed cases, whereas North Korea has the lowest prevalence, with only 300 instances reported.

•	The year 2022 has the most confirmed cases and virus transmission significantly decreased afterwards.

•	There have been 316, 910,296,319 confirmed cases worldwide, while 23,227,207,571 cases have been recovered.

# RECOMMENDATION
•	The constant promotion of preventative measures in all settings, including social isolation and distancing, mask use, hand washing, and sanitization, are crucial and required.

•	The importance of vaccination efforts should not be understated, especially for vulnerable communities or countries.

•	The health sector needs sufficient facilities and resources to get ready for potential upcoming outbreaks.

•	Assessments of the psychological health of people in recovery cases is required.
